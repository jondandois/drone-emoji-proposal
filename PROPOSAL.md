Proposal for Emoji: DRONE

0. Abstract

This purpose of this proposal is to suggest that a new emoji be added to the Unicode Standards for a drone: aka, a UAV "unmanned aerial vehicle", quadcopter, multirotor, etc.  The proposed emoji art takes the form of a multirotor "quadcopter" distinguished by 3 main components:

    1. A chasis or frame with a body, arms, and legs.
    2. Motors and propellors located on the ends of the arms.
    3. A camera or other sensor payload mounted below the frame and between the legs.

These 3 components and imagery do not reflect the style or brand of any one vendor (for example DJI, Parrot, Yuneec, Autel, Skydio, etc.).  The authors feel that this is a ubiquitous symbol that can be recognized around the world to represent a small flying machine that may be flown manually or autonomously and most likely carries a camera sensor.
